# Leadership

The goal of the team HULKs is to compete with other teams in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL).
Being competitive on such events with mostly part-time participating students requires optimal team performance and a focused development workflow to achieve set goals.
Two members of the HULKs manage and lead the team towards the goals.
These members are called *development leads*.
Beside participating in normal development activities, development leads act by representing multiple roles where each has responsibilities.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles exist at the HULKs which craft the development leads.

It identifies and fixes technical problems, consults the team or experts to acquire relevant information and makes decisions.
Knowledge and guidance is given via pairing, code reviews, or meetings.

### People Lead

It knows about interests, current activities, good and bad feelings of the team members.
The people lead establishes a constructive and open feedback culture in the team but may also forward feedback between team members and honor good performances publicly.

It ensures and supports that the team makes progress on the tasks and helps to break them down into sub-tasks.
It monitors work on the tasks, reminds to focus on essentials, notices blocked tasks and supports to unblock them, e.g., by connecting with experts or scheduling discussions in the team.
