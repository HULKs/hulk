At HULKs, we rely on self-motivation and self-organization.
We have a few rules and guidelines to ensure that we work efficiently and effectively.

Every wednesday, we have the development meeting, where we discuss recently merged pull requests, the current state of the project and usually do a test game.
Every second tuesday, we have the orga-meeting, where we discuss organizational topics.
If you just have joined the team and you're not quite sure if you want to stay, you should attend the weekly dev-meeting.
If you want to stay, you should attend both meetings.

!!! warning "Note"

    If you can't make a meeting, please let the team know in the team chat.
    It's fine to miss a meeting, but it's unfortunate if people are waiting for you.

To stay in the loop, it's a good idea to subscribe the Nextcloud calendar, ideally to your phone.

??? "Access to the calendar"

    To access the calendar, there is a public link which can be subscribed.
    Ask somebody in the team for the link.

To keep other team members up to date, [set up a github webhook](./github_webhooks.md) to automatically post your pushes to the _HULKs Pushes_ chat.

To start developing, continue with the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) guide.
