The HULKs use the [Yocto Project](https://yoctoproject.org) for creating a custom linux distribution, we call HULKs-OS.
The toolchain compiles all necessary dependencies, tools, and kernel to produce flashable OPN images for the NAO.
Additionally, Yocto provides means to construct a corresponding software development kit (SDK) containing a complete cross-compilation toolchain.

Team HULKs automatically releases the latest HULKs-OS publicly on GitHub [here](https://github.com/hulks/meta-nao/releases).
If you're looking to use these images or SDKs for flashing and deploying software onto your robot, you can opt for the pre-built versions and do not need to build your own image and SDK.

    Currently the team number is hardcoded into the image.
    To change it, several files need to be modified.
