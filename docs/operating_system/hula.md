# HUlks Level Abstraction (HULA)

HULA is an abstraction layer that connects to LoLA, the by [Aldebaran Robotics](https://corporate-internal-prod.aldebaran.com/) provided Low Level Abstraction of the NAOv6 and serves an interface for other applications.
Unlike LOLA, HULA also supports multiple clients.

## On the Nao

On the NAO, systemd manages the `hula.service`.
It can be stopped / started using standard systemd commands, such as `systemctl start hula`.

## Custom Build

To build HULA for the NAO,

1. Source the SDK by calling `. naosdk/<version>/environment-setup-corei7-64-aldebaran-linux` from the default HULKs folder.
   Be sure to use a POSIX compliant shell such as Bash (not Fish).
2. Use `cargo build` with the correct manifest path.
3. Copy the compiled binary from the target folder in the hula folder to the NAO using e.g. `scp`.
4. Connect to the NAO using `pepsi shell`
5. Stop the probably already running default hula by calling `systemctl stop hula`
6. Execute the copied hula binary
7. Enjoy ðŸš€

??? info "Installing the SDK"

    If you have never uploaded code to the NAO, first download the SDK using `pepsi sdk install`
