# NAO Image & SDK

The HULKs team utilizes the [Yocto Project](https://yoctoproject.org) to create a custom Linux distribution referred to as HULKs-OS.
The toolchain compiles all essential dependencies, tools, and the kernel to produce flashable OPN images for the NAO robot.
Yocto also facilitates the creation of a comprehensive software development kit (SDK) that includes a complete cross-compilation toolchain.

The latest version of HULKs-OS is automatically released publicly on GitHub [here](https://github.com/hulks/meta-nao/releases).
If you want to flash these images or deploy software onto your robot, you can use the pre-built versions without needing to create your own image and SDK.

When the NAO boots up, the image automatically configures both wired and wireless network devices.
Each robot is identified by its unique Head-ID, which is used to assign a specific IP address.
The mapping between Head-IDs and IP addresses is defined in the `team.toml` file, available [here](https://github.com/HULKs/hulk/tree/main/etc/parameters/team.toml), and is uploaded to the NAO during `pepsi gammaray`.

For any robots that arenâ€™t listed, the image defaults to configuring its wired network device using DHCP.
Thus, you're free to flash the HULKs-OS image onto a robot and find its IP address by inspecting your DHCP leases or asking your IT administrator.

## Creating the Image & SDK

The Yocto Project employs [BitBake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitBake) as a task execution engine and provides an abstraction layer for modifying and extending existing build configurations.
Combined with [OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page), the entire work environment is organized into several layers that configure the distribution and provide support for dependencies or services.
The foundational NAO support for creating a minimal NAO robot operating system for use in SPL is set up using the root `meta` layer in the [`meta-nao`](https://github.com/hulks/meta-nao) repository.
The HULKs overlay this configuration with an additional `meta-hulks` layer for their specific use case.

### Setting Up the Working Directory

To get started, clone the code and set up a Yocto working directory.
This working directory will contain the Yocto configuration layers, including [HULKs/meta-nao](https://github.com/HULKs/meta-nao) and `meta-hulks`.

```sh
mkdir yocto
cd yocto
```

!!! danger

    Ensure there is at least 100 GB of free disk space available for creating the image and SDK.

Clone the `meta-nao` repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:HULKs/meta-nao
```


We use [siemens/kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas), a setup tool for BitBake-based projects.
To run kas, either install it locally (see instructions [here](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)), or use the containerized version via the [kas-container script](https://github.com/siemens/kas/blob/master/kas-container).
We recommend the containerized method for its convenience and comprehensive package inclusions.
The `kas-container` script facilitates running a container via Podman or Docker.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemens/kas/master/kas-container
chmod u+x kas-container
```

Next, clone all necessary layers specified in our `kas-project.yml`.
This file defines the project structure that `kas` must set up for the Yocto build process.
Kas supports specifying multiple YAML project files, separated by a colon (`:`), allowing us to divide the configuration into multiple components.
To check out the repositories needed for a HULKs-specific image, run:

```sh
./kas-container checkout meta-nao/kas/base.yml:meta-nao/kas/hulks.yml
```

The final step involves populating the working directory with the proprietary and closed-source software by Aldebaran, notably LoLA and HAL for communication with the chestboard.
We do not provide these binaries; instead, they are extracted from the `.opn` files delivered with the RoboCupper image.
HULKs members can request the RoboCupper image from our dev leads, whereas non-members should contact the RoboCup SPL Technical Committee.

To extract the required binaries, we provide a script named `extract_binaries.sh`.
This script mounts the file system contained in the OPN image, retrieves all binaries from the RoboCupper image, and archives them for the subsequent build phase.
Note that mounting the OPN file system might require root privileges.

```sh
cd meta-nao/recipes-support/aldebaran/
mkdir -p aldebaran-binaries
./extract_binaries.sh -o aldebaran-binaries/aldebaran_binaries.tar.gz nao-2.8.5.11_ROBOCUP_ONLY_with_root.opn
```

Your working directory is now ready to build your own NAO image and SDK.
You may customize the distribution to suit your needs, such as installing additional dependencies, configuring the kernel, and more.

### Initiating a Build Shell

`kas` can start a shell within the build environment.
Reference the `kas-project.yml` of meta-nao:

```sh
# working directory is `yocto`
./kas-container shell meta-nao/kas/base.yml:meta-nao/kas/hulks.yml
```

All BitBake and Devtool commands should be executed from within this shell.

### Building the Image

Within the build shell, you can build a NAO OPN image and SDK using BitBake.
The initial build may take several hours, depending on your computer's performance and download speed.
Keep in mind that you're building an entire Linux distribution.
BitBake provides advanced caching of build artifacts, which significantly reduces the duration of future builds to minutes or even seconds, depending on the changes made.
The cache resides in `build/sstate-cache`, which can be copied from another build directory or shared between machines.
For more information, refer to the [Yocto Documentation on Shared State Cache](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/overview-manual/concepts.html#shared-state-cache).
To build the image, run the following command from within the build shell:

```sh
bitbake nao-image
```

This command generates and executes all necessary tasks and targets to create a proper `.opn` file.
Once BitBake completes the `nao-image` task, the image file will be located at `build/tmp/deploy/images/nao-v6/nao-image-HULKs-OS-[...].ext3.gz.opn`.
The image can be directly flashed to a NAO as detailed in the [NAO setup](./nao_setup.md#flashing-the-firmware) section.

### Building the SDK

To compile software targeting the NAO platform, the code needs to be cross-compiled for the NAO target.
When you only change configuration for the NAO image, you may still maintain compatibility with the publicly released SDK at [meta-nao](https://github.com/hulks/meta-nao/releases) and opt for this SDK instead of building your own.

Within the build shell, execute the following command to build a complete SDK:

```sh
bitbake -c populate_sdk nao-image
```

Again, this process might take several hours.
After a successful build, the SDK will be located at `build/tmp/deploy/sdk/HULKs-OS-toolchain-[...].sh`.
To install the SDK, run the script and follow the instructions.
Once installed, you can source the build environment and use the respective cross-compilers.

### Advanced Topics

#### Updating Yocto Layers

The Yocto Project and the Poky reference distribution provide a Linux kernel, userland programs, libraries, and other tooling, which are regularly updated in Yocto releases.
To ensure deterministic builds, the HULKs freeze the versions of all used layers in the `kas-project.yml` files of meta-nao.

#### Versioning of Image/SDKs Using Semantic Versioning

The HULKs adhere to semantic versioning for Yocto images and SDKs.
This versioning system increases version numbers based on the nature of the changes:

- Both images and SDKs have major, minor, and patch version numbers (e.g., 4.2.3).
- Images and SDKs with the same major and minor version numbers are compatible with each other.
- Major changes, refactorings, or implementations necessitate an increase in the major version number.
- Minor changes, additions, and iterations necessitate an increase in the minor version number.
- Changes in the image that do not require SDK recreation result in an increase in the patch version number. Consequently, only a new image needs to be created, not necessarily a redistribution of new SDKs.

Before building new images, the version number must be set in `meta-nao/conf/distro/HULKsOS.conf`.
Only modify the `DISTROVERSION`; the `SDKVERSION` is automatically derived from the `DISTRO_VERSION`.

After releasing a new image and/or SDK, update the `OSVERSION` and/or `SDKVERSION` variables in `crates/constants/src/lib.rs`.
Successive builds with pepsi will use the new version.

#### Upgrade Rust Version

Since upgrading the Rust version often requires manual steps, this section describes the approach on how to upgrade and generate the needed patch files.
These instructions can be followed e.g. if a new Rust version is available and a new image/SDK should be created with this new version.
Users that just want to use the current version that we upgraded to should skip this section.

Rust is provided by the poky repository.
The recipes are located in `meta/recipes-devtools/{cargo,rust}`.
The following steps are high-level instructions on how to modify the poky repository.
A patch file can be created after applying these instructions and saved to the corresponding meta-hulks layer.

-   Set new version in the `RUSTVERSION` variable in `poky/meta/conf/distro/include/tcmode-default.inc`
-   Rename files (to new version) in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/cargo/`
-   Rename files (to new version) in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/`
-   Some LLVM benchmarks are built and run during the compilation which often results in errors.
    Therefore, it is a good idea to just exclude them by appending `-DLLVM_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF` and `-DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF` to the `EXTRA_OECMAKE` variable in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/rust-llvm.inc`.
-   Set new version in the `RS_VERSION` and `CARGO_VERSION` variable in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/rust-snapshot.inc`
-   Update the checksums in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/rust-snapshot.inc` for the NAO architecture `x86_64`
    -   Download the files in your command line (example for Rust version 1.63):
    ```sh
    RS_VERSION="1.63.0"
    CARGO_VERSION="1.63.0"
    RUST_BUILD_ARCH="x86_64"
    RUST_STD_SNAPSHOT="rust-std-${RS_VERSION}-${RUST_BUILD_ARCH}-unknown-linux-gnu"
    RUSTC_SNAPSHOT="rustc-${RS_VERSION}-${RUST_BUILD_ARCH}-unknown-linux-gnu"
    CARGO_SNAPSHOT="cargo-${CARGO_VERSION}-${RUST_BUILD_ARCH}-unknown-linux-gnu"
    wget "https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/${RUST_STD_SNAPSHOT}.tar.xz"
    wget "https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/${RUSTC_SNAPSHOT}.tar.xz"
    wget "https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/${CARGO_SNAPSHOT}.tar.xz"
    ```
    -   Generate the checksums in the same terminal:
        ```sh
        sha256sum ${RUST_STD_SNAPSHOT}.tar.xz ${RUSTC_SNAPSHOT}.tar.xz ${CARGO_SNAPSHOT}.tar.xz
        ```
    -   Keep the terminal open for the next step
-   Update the checksums in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/rust-source.inc`
    -   Download the files:
        ```sh
        wget "https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rustc-${RS_VERSION}-src.tar.xz"
        ```
    -   Generate the checksums in the same terminal:
        ```sh
        sha256sum "rustc-${RS_VERSION}-src.tar.xz"
        ```
-   Run `bitbake nao-image` within the build shell
    -   Errors similar to `libstd-rs-1.63.0-r0 do_patch: Applying patch...` often mean that patches are obsolete.
        These patches are located in `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/libstd-rs/` and `poky/meta/recipes-devtools/rust/rust-llvm/`.
        Deleted patches need to be removed from their corresponding recipes.
        Afterwards rerun the image build.
-   Once a successful build completed, create a patch from the changes in poky:
    -   ```sh
        cd poky/
        git add .
        git commit # ...
        git format-patch HEAD~  # this generates 0001-....patch
        ```
    -   Copy the patch file into `meta-nao/patches/0001....patch` and fix the patch path in `meta-nao/kas-project.yml`
