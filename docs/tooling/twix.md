# Installation

Twix doesn't have to be installed to be used, it can be directly run from the repository with `./twix` (just as pepsi).
But you can also install it into your local system to conveniently use it without rebuilding:

```
cargo install --path tools/twix
```

Twix is subsequently installed at `~/.cargo/bin/twix`. <br>

!!! tip

    Don't forget to update it from time to time by reinstalling it to get the latest features and bugfixes.

# Configuration

Twix loads a user configuration file on startup. The location of the configuration file depends on your platform:

-   Linux: `/home/alice/.config/hulks/twix.toml`
-   Windows: `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\hulks\twix.toml`
-   MacOS: `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/hulks/twix.toml`

See the example config further down on this page for the general format.

After loading the user configuration, it is merged with the default values, which are defined in `tools/twix/config_default.toml`.

## Keybindings

You can customize your keybindings by modifying the `[keys]` table in your user configuration file.
Each table entry is of the form `(trigger) = "(action)"`.
A keybind trigger is a hyphen-separated list of zero or more modifiers, terminated by a key.

See [here](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/c1eb3f884db8bc4f52dbae4f261619cee651f411/crates/egui/src/data/key.rs#L298-L413)
for a complete list of bindable keys.

Possible modifiers are `A` (Alt), `C` (Ctrl), and `S` (Shift).
When binding a single-letter key, it is also possible and preferred to specify "Shift" by capitalizing the letter, e.g. `C-T` for Ctrl+Shift+T.

!!! example "Example keybind triggers"

    -   `C-t`: Ctrl + T
    -   `C-T`: Ctrl + Shift + T
    -   `A-S-Esc`: Alt + Shift + Escape

Possible actions are:
